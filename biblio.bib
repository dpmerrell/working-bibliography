They are being used to model molecular mechanisms with varying degrees of granularity?from elementary reactions to causal links?and to describe these systems by various dynamic mathematical frameworks, such as Boolean networks or systems of differential equations. The models can be based exclusively on experimental data, or on prior knowledge of the underlying biological processes. The latter are typically generic, but can be adapted to a certain context, such as a particular cell type, after training with context-specific data. Dynamic mechanistic models that are based on biological knowledge have great potential for modeling specific systems, because they require less data for training to provide biological insight in particular into causal mechanisms, and to extrapolate to scenarios that are outside the conditions they have been trained on.},

The domain-based modular architecture of signaling proteins may have facilitated the evolution of complex biological systems, and can be exploited experimentally to generate synthetic signaling pathways and artificial mechanisms of autoregulation. Pathogenic proteins, such as those encoded by bacteria and viruses, frequently form ectopic signaling complexes to respecify cellular behavior. In a similar fashion, proteins expressed as a consequence of oncogenic fusions, mutations or amplifications can elicit ectopic protein{\textendash}protein interactions that re-wire signaling pathways, in a fashion that promotes malignancy. Compounds that directly or indirectly reverse these aberrant interactions offer new possibilities for therapy in cancer.},

These networks, which are composed of protein kinases, protein phosphatases and their respective cellular targets, are highly dynamic. Importantly, to achieve signaling specificity, phosphorylation networks must be regulated at several levels, including at the level of protein expression, substrate recognition, and spatiotemporal modulation of enzymatic activity. Here, we briefly summarize some of the traditional methods used to study the phosphorylation status of cellular proteins before focusing our attention on several recent technological advances, such as protein microarrays, quantitative mass spectrometry, and genetically-targetable fluorescent biosensors, that are offering new insights into the organization and regulation of cellular phosphorylation networks. Together, these approaches promise to lead to a systems-level view of dynamic phosphorylation networks.},
