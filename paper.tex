\section{Signaling pathway network inference}

\subsection{Constraint-based approaches}

\paragraph{ \citet{2018-koksal-tps}. Temporal Pathway Synthesizer (TPS). }




\subsection{Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN) approaches}

\paragraph{ \citet{2017-hill-context}. Context specificity \ldots phosphoprotein profiling.}
The authors build on their previous works 
\citep{2015-spencer-interventional} 
\citep{2014-oates-joint}
to infer context-specific signaling pathways from phosphorylation data.
They consider (4 cell lines) $\times$ (8 perturbagens) $=$ 32 different contexts.
For each context they apply 6 different kinase inhibitor interventions, and incorporate the resulting causal information into their context-specific pathway reconstruction.
\citeauthor{2017-hill-context} validate the novel edges predicted by their method through western blot analysis.

\paragraph{ \citet{2015-spencer-interventional}. Inferring networks from interventional data.}

\paragraph{ \citet{2014-oates-joint}. Joint estimation of multiple related biological networks.}
The authors present a method for inferring multiple related networks simultaneously.
They do so by defining a hierarchical model whose leaves are networks;
they infer the network posteriors via belief propagation.
The results are exact, since the networks' parameters can be marginalized exactly and the hierarchical model contains no loops. 

\paragraph{ \citet{hill-bayesian-2012} Bayesian inference of signaling network topology.}
The authors present an exact Bayesian inference method for signaling pathways.
They use DBNs to represent the causal dependencies of phosphorylation events.
The strength of a DBN representation is that it leads to a straightforward Bayesian formulation:
$P(G|X) \propto \int P(X|G, \theta) \cdot P(G) \cdot P(\theta) d\theta$, where $P(X|G, \theta)$ is
simply the probability of the data given a particular DBN.
The authors also show that suitable priors $P(G)$ and $P(\theta)$ reduce the posterior $P(G|X)$
to a tractable sum (polynomial number of terms---the polynomial degree is given by an in-degree constraint on $G$).


\subsection{Belief Propagation/Prize-Collecting Steiner Tree approaches}

\paragraph{ \citet{2013-molinelli-perturbation}. Inferring networks for perturbed cells.}
The authors use the belief-propagation method described by \citeauthor{2012-biazzo-steiner} to infer 
MUST REREAD --- DO NOT YET FULLY GRASP THIS ONE.

\paragraph{ \citet{2012-biazzo-steiner}. Performance of a cavity-method-based algorithm for the prize-collecting Steiner tree problem on graphs.}
The authors explain how the PCST objective function can be regarded as a log-probability over trees, and then maximize it (approximately) using a belief-propagation algorithm.
They show that it compares favorably against other PCST solvers---typically based on integer program formulations---on a standard set of PCST benchmarks.
Their method usually converges faster \emph{and} attains higher scores than the others.

\subsection{Other Works}

\paragraph{ \citet{2018-invergo-review}. Review of phosphorylation network reconstruction methods. }

\paragraph{ \citet{2016-hill-community}. Inferring causal molecular networks \ldots community-based effort.}
This paper describes the outcomes of a phosphorylation network reconstruction DREAM challenge.
Participants attempted to infer context-specific causal signaling networks from (a) simulated data and (b) real phosphorylation time-series measurements.
The participants submitted their networks, which were evaluated against held-out test sets.
The challenge evaluated a very particular notion of causality---i.e., two phosphorylation events ought to be causally related iff there exists a directed path from one to the other in the inferred network.
Two submissions reliably attained the highest scores; one was based on a notion of Granger causality and the other was based on a nonparametric hypothesis test for functional dependence of variables.
The latter did not even make use of prior biological knowledge (e.g., pathway databases curated by scientists).

\paragraph{ \citet{2008-mukherjee-priors}. Network inference using informative priors.}
The authors describe the network inference task and present a family of prior distributions for networks:
$ P(G) \propto \exp\left( \lambda \sum_i w_i f_i(G) \right).$ 
That is, the probability of a graph is some log-linear function of various graph features. 
\citeauthor{2008-mukherjee-priors} use this family of priors in conjunction with 
(a) exact marginal likelihood $P(X | G) = \int P(X | G, \theta) P(\theta) d\theta$, and
(b) MCMC sampling
to estimate expectations of features in the posterior network.
They evaluate their inference method via 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item a simulation study; they estimate the probabilities of edge existence in the posterior network
        and generate an ROC curve for these predictions.
    \item reconstructing a signaling pathway from phosphorylation data; they compare the most likely
        graph against expert knowledge of this particular pathway.
\end{enumerate}
